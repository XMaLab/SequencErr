## SequencErr 

**SequencErr** app is available on St. Jude Cloud at https://platform.dnanexus.com/app/sequencerr for non-profit research uses. 

## Requirements

Following packages and their respective dependencies should be installed before using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts in this repository. At the time of analysis [R](https://www.r-project.org/) v3.6.1 was used to generate the figures.

* beeswarm
* ggpubr
* pheatmap
* RColorBrewer

```
install.packages(c('beeswarm', 'ggpubr', 'pheatmap', 'RColorBrewer'), repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org', dependencies = TRUE)
```
